Gomponent
==================================

This is an open.mp component for loading gamemodes written in Go with the [gomp!](https://github.com/kodeyeen/gomp) package.
The name `Gomponent` is composed of three word-forming elements:
1. Go
2. omp (short for open.mp)
3. Component

Similar to goroutines (go coroutines) in Go.

## Usage

Put the component files into your project's `components` directory so it can be loaded by open.mp server and find your gamemodes in the `gamemodes` folder.
